<p>
    Just a browser-based pong clone from my early years of programming.
    One of the first ever games I built using 2D graphics.
</p>

<p>
    Use W+S keys to control player 1 (left) and Up+Down arrow keys to control player 2 (right).
</p>

<p>
    Built with raw HTML/CSS/JS using
    the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a> element
    to render graphics.
</p>

<p>
    I had this on my website in high school and we used to chain 3 monitors together during
    computer class and play a very wide game of pong. Good fun.
