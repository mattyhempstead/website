<p>
    This game from 2015 might be the first program I ever completed and shared with others.
</p>

<p>
    Cookie clicker had gone viral a couple years earlier and
    inspired a number of other idle games that we were all playing
    at the time on our
    hand-me-down <abbr title="myself on an iPhone 4; my first phone">smartphones</abbr>.

    For some reason I then decided to create a soil-based version (probably a mixture of
    wanting alliteration and playing too much Minecraft).
</p>

<p>
    The whole thing is a single HTML file that contains a mixture of raw HTML/CSS/JS,
    which I remember bringing to school on a USB and distributing it to my friends where we
    would play it in class instead of doing work.
</p>

<p>
    It should probably be noted I originally only added up to the "Soil Bulldozer",
    but when competition had people reaching that milestone I outsourced the naming
    of additional auto-shovellers to my friends (thus the breakdown in consistency
    and questionable choices).
