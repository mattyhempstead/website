<p>
    A simple clone of the Facebook messenger soccer game I made in
    high school with Python and <a href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about">pygame</a>.

<h2>
    Why did I make this?
</h2>
<p>
    Just really enjoyed programming at the time (still do!).
    Saw the Facebook game with its simple yet effective use of gravity and thought to myself
    one school afternoon "hey I bet I can make this!".
</p>

{/* 
    TODO: More info about the tech stack and stuff maybe?
    - ball made in paint
    - a good early project bc it lets u code velocity and gravity from scratch in a simple environment (no physics engine) while still being useful.
    - circle radius style collision detection with mouse (good to learn imo)
