        <p>
            Basically just a bunch of particles doing typical particle things with each other while I hope that the 3 states of matter emerge.
            <br>
            You gotta spam the cool/heat buttons heaps for it to have any effect.
            <!-- <br><br>
            The particles keep undergoing sublimation (and deposition) as they only seem to exist as either solid or gas.
            <br>
            Getting liquid phase to appear is really hard and either requires lots more particles or 
            careful tweaking of all the variables.
            <br>
            Maybe having lots more particles will make it easier but this is an O(n<sup>2</sup>) problem and my code is terribly inefficient. -->
